                    <h2>Learn JavaScript in a fun way!</h2>
                    <p>If you want to become a back-end web developer or full stack web developer then you must know
                        JavaScript for sure. Many beginners have complaint that in YouTube they teach JavaScript but not
                        in an fun manner. If they teach in a fun manner too they teach only basics which are of no use.
                        So, I have come up with the idea of creating an ultimate JavaScript course. Thank You Vikram for
                        suggesting me.</p>

                    <h2>CSS from Zero to Hero!</h2>
                    <p>CSS is the clothes of a website and without any style you can publish a HTML site but no one is
                        gonna visit that because they will not like the structure of the page. In this course I have
                        made CSS easy for you. And you are gonna surely comment "awesome course". This course is
                        absolutely for beginners and this takes you from Zero to Hero in CSS. This course is also gonna
                        tell you how to make a website that people love. So, learn CSS and make your sites good looking.

                    <h2>HTML from scratch</h2>
                    <p>This course is gonna take you to your destination as a web developer in HTML. HTML is the
                        important programming language for web development. Without HTML no website. If you want a
                        career in web development or you are learning coding just for fun also this course is gonna
                        really help you. As I have already told you No HTML = No WebSites. Even if you use a backend for
                        your website the backend is gonna deliver HTML pages only. So, complete the course and start
                        making websites.</p>
